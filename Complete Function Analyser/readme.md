## Project description

This is a complete function analyser program implemented in Python using the Sympy package.

The program takes in a rational function (a fraction of two polynomials) as an input, and outputs the roots, local extrema, discontinuity points, and inflection points of the function, along with the monotonicity of the function between these critical points.

This project was a homework exercise in the Introduction to Python lecture I took during Spring 2020.
